What is the Central Limit Theorem and why is it important? \\n“Suppose that we are interested in estimating the average height among all people. Collecting data for \\nevery person in the world is impossible. While we can’t obtain a height measurement from everyone in the \\npopulation, we can still sample some people. The question now becomes, what can we say about the \\naverage height of the entire population given a single sample. The Central Limit Theorem addresses this \\nquestion exactly.” Read more here. \\n2. What is sampling? How many sampling methods do you know? \\n“Data sampling is a statistical analysis technique used to select, manipulate and analyze a representative \\nsubset of data points to identify patterns and trends in the larger data set being examined.” Read the full \\nanswer here. \\n3. What is the difference between type I vs type II error? \\n“A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is true, but is rejected. A type II error occurs when the null \\nhypothesis is false, but erroneously fails to be rejected.” Read the full answer here. \\n4. What is linear regression? What do the terms p-value, coefficient, and r-squared \\nvalue mean? What is the significance of each of these components? \\nA linear regression is a good tool for quick predictive analysis: for example, the price of a house depends \\non a myriad of factors, such as its size or its location. In order to see the relationship between these \\nvariables, we need to build a linear regression, which predicts the line of best fit between them and can \\nhelp conclude whether or not these two factors have a positive or negative relationship. Read \\nmore here and here. \\n5. What are the assumptions required for linear regression? \\nThere are four major assumptions: 1. There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and \\nthe regressors, meaning the model you are creating actually fits the data, 2. The errors or residuals of the \\ndata are normally distributed and independent from each other, 3. There is minimal multicollinearity \\nbetween explanatory variables, and 4. Homoscedasticity. This means the variance around the regression \\nline is the same for all values of the predictor variable. \\n6. What is a statistical interaction? \\n”Basically, an interaction is when the effect of one factor (input variable) on the dependent variable (output \\nvariable) differs among levels of another factor.” Read more here. \\n7. What is selection bias? \\n“Selection (or ‘sampling’) bias occurs in an ‘active,’ sense when the sample data that is gathered and \\nprepared for modeling has characteristics that are not representative of the true, future population of cases'),\n",

What is Data Science? List the differences between supervised and unsupervised \\nlearning. \\nData Science is a blend of various tools, algorithms, and machine learning principles with the goal to discover \\nhidden patterns from the raw data. How is this different from what statisticians have been doing for years? \\nThe answer lies in the difference between explaining and predicting. \\n \\nThe differences between supervised and unsupervised learning are as follows; \\nSupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning \\nInput data is labelled. Input data is unlabelled. \\nUses a training data set. Uses the input data set. \\nUsed for prediction. Used for analysis. \\nEnables classification and regression. Enables Classification, Density Estimation, & Dimension Reduction \\nQ2. What is Selection Bias? \\nSelection bias is a kind of error that occurs when the researcher decides who is going to be studied.

It is the distortion of statistical analysis, resulting from the method of collecting \\nsamples. If the selection bias is not taken into account , then some conclusions of the study may not be \\naccurate. \\nThe types of selection bias include: \\n1. Sampling bias: It is a systematic error due to a non -random sample of a population causing some \\nmembers of the population to be less likely to be included than others resulting in a biased sample. \\n2. Time interval: A trial may be terminated early at an extreme value (often for ethical reasons), but the \\nextreme value is likely to be reached by the variable with the largest variance, even if all variable s \\nhave a similar mean. \\n3. Data: When specific subsets of data are chosen to support a conclusion or rejection of bad data on \\narbitrary grounds, instead of according to previously stated or generally agreed criteria. \\n4. Attrition: Attrition bias is a kind of selection bias caused by attrition (loss of participants) discounting \\ntrial subjects/tests that did not run to completion. \\nQ3. What is bias-variance trade-off? \\nBias: Bias is an error introduced in your model due to oversimplification of the machine learning al gorithm. \\nIt can lead to underfitting. When you train  your model at that time model makes simplified assumptions to \\nmake the target function easier to understand. \\nLow bias machine learning algorithms — Decision Trees, k -NN and SVM High bias machine learning  \\nalgorithms — Linear Regression, Logistic Regression \\nVariance: Variance is error introduced in your model due to complex machine learning algorithm, your model \\nlearns noise also from the training data set and performs badly on test data set. It can lead to high sensitivity \\nand overfitting. \\nNormally, as you increase the complexity of your model, you will see a reduction in error due to lower bias \\nin the model. However, this only happens until a particular point. As you continue to make your model more \\ncomplex, you end up over-fitting your model and hence your model will start suffering from high variance. \\n \\nBias-Variance trade-off: The goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to have low bias and \\nlow variance to achieve good prediction performance.'),\n",

Both Correlation and Covariance establish the relationship and also measure t he dependency \\nbetween two random variables. Though the work is similar between these tw o in mathematical terms, they \\nare different from each other. \\nCorrelation: \\nCorrelation is considered or described as the best technique for measuring and also for estima ting the \\nquantitative relationship between two variables. Correlation measures how stro ngly two variables are \\nrelated. \\nCovariance: In covariance two items vary together and it’s a measure that indicates the extent to which two \\nrandom variables change in cycle. It is a statistical term; it explains the systematic relation between a pair of \\nrandom variables, wherein changes in one variable reciprocal by a corresponding change in another \\nvariable. \\nQ8. What is the difference between Point Estimates and Confidence Interval? \\nPoint Estimation gives us a particular value as an estimate of a populatio n parameter. Method of Moments \\nand Maximum Likelihood estimator methods are used to derive Point Estimators for population parameters. \\nA confidence interval gives us a r ange of values which is likely to contain the population parameter.

What is p-value? \\nWhen you perform a hypothesis test in statistics, a p -value can help you determine the strength of your \\nresults. p-value is a number between 0 and 1. Based on the value it will denote the strength of the results. \\nThe claim which is on trial is called the Null Hypothesis. \\nLow p -value (≤ 0.05) indicates strength against the null hypothesis which means we can reject the null \\nHypothesis.

How can you generate a random number between 1 – 7 with only a die? \\n• Any die has six sides from 1-6. There is no way to get seven equal outcomes from a single rolling of \\na die. If we roll the die twice and consider the event of two rolls, we now have 36 different outcomes. \\n• To get our 7 equal outcomes we have to reduce this 36 to a number divisible by 7. We can thus \\nconsider only 35 outcomes and exclude the other one. \\n• A simple scenario can be to exclude the combination (6,6), i.e., to roll the die again if 6 appears twice. \\n• All the remaining combinations from (1,1) till (6,5) can be divided into 7 parts of 5 each. This way all \\nthe seven sets of outcomes are equally likely. \\nQ13. A certain couple tells you that they have two children, at least one of which is a girl. What is the \\nprobability that they have two girls? \\nIn the case of two children, there are 4 equally likely possibilities  \\nBB, BG, GB and GG; \\nwhere B = Boy and G = Girl and the first letter denotes the first child. \\nFrom the question, we  can exclude the first case of BB.  Thus from the remaining 3 possibilities \\nof BG, GB & BB, we have to find the probability of the case with two girls. \\nThus, P(Having two girls given one girl)   =    1 / 3'),\n",

Explain Star Schema. \\nIt is a traditional database schema with a central tab le. Satellite tables map IDs to physical names or \\ndescriptions and can be connected to the central fact table using the ID fields; these tables are known as \\nlookup tables and are principally useful in real -time applications, as they save a lot of memory. S ometimes \\nstar schemas involve several layers of summarization to recover information faster. \\nQ32. What is Cluster Sampling? \\nCluster sampling is a technique used when it becomes difficult to study the target population spread across \\na wide area and simple random sampling cannot be applied. Cluster Sample is a probability sample where \\neach sampling unit is a collection or cluster of elements. \\nFor eg., A researcher wants to survey the academic performance of high school students in Japan. He can \\ndivide the entire population of Japan into different clusters (cities). Then the researcher selects a number of \\nclusters depending on his research through simple or systematic random sampling. \\nLet’s continue our Data Science Interview Questions blog with some more statistics questions. \\nQ33. What is Systematic Sampling? \\nSystematic sampling is a statistical technique where elements are selected from an ordered sampling frame. \\nIn systematic sampling, the list is progressed in a circular manner so once you reach the end of the list, it is \\nprogressed from the top again. The best example of systematic sampling is equal probability method. \\nQ34. What are Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues? \\nEigenvectors are used for understanding linear transformations.  In data analysis, we usually calc ulate the \\neigenvectors for a correlation or covariance matrix. Eigenvectors are the directions along which a particular \\nlinear transformation acts by flipping, compressing or stretching. \\nEigenvalue can be referred to as the strength of the transformation i n the direction of eigenvector or the \\nfactor by which the compression occurs. \\nQ35. Can you cite some examples where a false positive is important than a false negative? \\nLet us first understand what false positives and false negatives are. \\n• False Positives are the cases where you wrongly classified a non -event as an event a.k.a Type I \\nerror. \\n• False Negatives are the cases where you wrongly classify events as non-events, a.k.a Type II error. \\nExample 1:  In the medical field, assume you have to  give chemotherapy to patients. Assume a patient \\ncomes to that hospital and he is tested positive for cancer, based on the lab prediction but he actually doesn’t \\nhave cancer. This is a case of false positive. Here it is of utmost danger to start chemotherapy on this patient \\nwhen he actually does not have cancer. In the absence of cancerous cell, chemotherapy will do certain \\ndamage to his normal healthy cells and might lead to severe diseases, even cancer. \\nExample 2: Let’s say an e-commerce company decided to give $1000 Gift voucher to the customers whom \\nthey assume to purchase at least $10,000 worth of items.  They send free voucher mail directly to 100 \\ncustomers without any minimum purchase condition because they assume to make at least 20% profit on \\nsold items above $10,000. Now the issue is if we send the $1000 gift vouchers to customers who have not \\nactually purchased anything but are marked as having made $10,000 worth of purchase.'),\n",

Can you cite some examples where a false negative important than a false positive? \\nExample 1: Assume there is an airport ‘A’ which has received high -security threats and based on certain \\ncharacteristics they identify whether a particular passenger can be a threat or not. Due to a shortage of staff, \\nthey decide to scan passengers being predicted as risk positives by their predictive model. What will happen \\nif a true threat customer is being flagged as non-threat by airport model? \\nExample 2: What if Jury or judge decides to make a criminal go free? \\nExample 3: What if you rejec ted to marry a very  good person based on your predictive model and you \\nhappen to meet him/her after a few years and realize that you had a false negative? \\nQ37. Can you cite some examples where both false positive and false negatives are equally \\nimportant? \\nIn the Banking industry giving loans is the primary source of making money but at the same time if your \\nrepayment rate is not good you will not make any profit, rather you will risk huge losses. \\nBanks don’t want to lose good customers and at the same point  in time, they don’ t want to acquire bad \\ncustomers. In this scenario, both the false positives and false negatives become very important to measure. \\nQ38. Can you explain the difference between a Validation Set and a Test Set? \\nA Validation set can be considered as a part of the training set as it is used for parameter selection and to \\navoid overfitting of the model being built. \\nOn the other hand, a Test Set is used for testing or evaluating the performance of a trained machine learning \\nmodel. \\nIn simple terms, the differences can be summarized as; training set is to fit the parameters i.e. weights and \\ntest set is to assess the performance of the model i.e. evaluating the predictive power and generalization. \\nQ39. Explain cross-validation. \\nCross-validation is a model validation te chnique for evaluating how the outcomes of statistical analysis \\nwill generalize to an independent dataset. Mainly used in backgrounds where the objective is forecast and \\none wants to estimate how accurately a model will accomplish in practice. \\nThe goal of cross-validation is to term a data set to test the model in the training phase (i.e. validation data \\nset) in order to limit problems like overfitting and get an insight on how the model will generalize to an \\nindependent data set. \\n  \\nMACHINE LEARNING INTERVIEW QUESTIONS \\nQ40. What is Machine Learning? \\nMachine Learning  explores the study and construction of algorithms that can learn from and make \\npredictions o n data.  Closely rela ted to computational statistics.  Used to devise complex models and \\nalgorithms that lend themselves to a prediction which in commercial use is known as predictive analytics. \\nGiven below, is an image representing the various domains Machine Learning lends itself to.'),\n",

How can outlier values be treated? \\nOutlier values can be identified by using univariate or any other graphical analysis method. If the number of \\noutlier values is few then they can be assessed individually but for a large number of outliers, the values can \\nbe substituted with either the 99th or the 1st percentile values. \\nAll extreme values are not outlier values.

Describe the structure of Artificial Neural Networks? \\nArtificial Neural Networks works on the same principle as a biological Neural Network. It con sists of inputs \\nwhich get processed with weighted sums and Bias, with the help of Activation Functions.'),\n",

How Are Weights Initialized in a Network? \\nThere are two methods here: we can either initialize the weights to zero or assign them randomly. \\nInitializing all weights to 0: This makes your model similar to a linear model. All the neurons and every layer \\nperform the same operation, giving the same output and making the deep net useless. \\nInitializing all weights randomly: Here, the weights are assigned randomly by init ializing them very close to \\n0. It gives better accuracy to the model since every neuron performs different computations. This is the most \\ncommonly used method. \\nQ76. What Is the Cost Function? \\nAlso referred to as “loss” or “error,” cost function is a measur e to evaluate how good your model’s \\nperformance is. It’s used to compute the error of the output layer during backpropagation. We push that error \\nbackwards through the neural network and use that during the different training functions. \\nQ77. What Are Hyperparameters? \\nWith neural networks, you’re usually working with hyperparameters once the data is formatted correctly. A \\nhyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. It determines how a \\nnetwork is trained and the struct ure of the network (such as the number of hidden units, the learning rate, \\nepochs, etc.). \\nQ78. What Will Happen If the Learning Rate Is Set inaccurately (Too Low or Too High)? \\nWhen your learning rate is too low, training of the model will progress very slowly as we are making minimal \\nupdates to the weights. It will take many updates before reaching the minimum point. \\nIf the learning rate is set too high, this causes unde sirable divergent behaviour to the loss function due to \\ndrastic updates in weights. It m ay fail to converge (model can give a good output) or even diverge (data is \\ntoo chaotic for the network to train). \\nQ79. What Is the Difference Between Epoch, Batch, and Iteration in Deep Learning? \\n• Epoch – Represents one iteration over the entire dataset (everything put into the training model). \\n• Batch – Refers to when we cannot pass the entire dataset into the neural network at once, so we \\ndivide the dataset into several batches.'),\n",

What Are the Different Layers on CNN? \\nThere are four layers in CNN: \\n1. Convolutional Layer –  the layer that perfo rms a convolutional operation, creating several smaller \\npicture windows to go over the data. \\n2. ReLU Layer – it brings non-linearity to the network and converts all the ne gative pixels to zero. The \\noutput is a rectified feature map. \\n3. Pooling Layer – pooling is a down-sampling operation that reduces the dimensionality of the feature \\nmap. \\n4. Fully Connected Layer – this layer recognizes and classifies the objects in the image. \\nQ81. What Is \\nPooling on CNN, and How Does It Work? \\nPooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions of a CNN. It performs down-sampling operations to reduce \\nthe dimensionality and creates a pooled feature map by sliding a filter matrix over the input matrix. \\nQ82. What are Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs)? \\nRNNs are a type of artificial neural networks designed to recognise  the pattern from the sequence of data \\nsuch as Time series, stock market and government agencies etc. To understand recurrent nets, first, you \\nhave to understand the basics of feedforward nets. \\nBoth these networks RNN and feed-forward named after the way they channel information through a series \\nof mathematical orations performed at the nodes of the network. One feeds information through \\nstraight(never touching the same node twice), while the oth er cycles it through a loop, and the latter are \\ncalled recurrent.'),\n",

So recurrent networks have two sources of input, the present and the recent past, which \\ncombine to determine how they respond to new data, much as we do in life. \\nThe error they generate will return via backpropagation and be used to adjust their weights until error can’t \\ngo any lower.

How Does an LSTM Network Work? \\nLong-Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network capable of learning long-\\nterm dependencies, remembering information for long periods as its default behaviour. There are three \\nsteps in an LSTM network: \\n• Step 1: The network decides what to forget and what to remember. \\n• Step 2: It selectively updates cell state values. \\n• Step 3: The network decides what part of the current state makes it to the output. \\nQ84.

It has the \\nsame structure as a single layer perceptron with one or more hidden layers. A single layer perceptron can \\nclassify only linear separable classes with binary output (0,1), but MLP can classify nonlinear classes. \\nExcept for the input layer, each node in the other \\nlayers uses a nonlinear activation function. This means the input layers, the data coming in, and the \\nactivation function is based upon all nodes and weights being added together, producing the output. MLP \\nuses a supervised learning method called “backpropagation.” In backpropagation, the neural network \\ncalculates the error with the help of cost function. It propagates this error backward from where it came \\n(adjusts the weights to train the model more accurately). \\nQ85. Explain Gradient Descent. \\nTo Understand Gradient Descent, Let’s understand what is a Gradient first. \\nA gradient measures how much the output of a function changes if you change the inputs a little bit. It \\nsimply measures the change in all weights with regard to the change in error. You can also think of a \\ngradient as the slope of a function. \\nGradient Descent can be thought of climbing down to the bottom of a valley, instead of climbing up a \\nhill.

At an extreme, the values of weights can become so large as to overflow and result in \\nNaN values. \\nThis has the effect of your model is unstable and unable to learn from your training data. \\nQ87.
